+  6621,  &quot;The installed set of policies on the log is invalid.\r\n&quot;
+  6622,  &quot;A policy on the log in question prevented the operation from completing.\r\n&quot;
+  6623,  &quot;Log space cannot be reclaimed because the log is pinned by the archive tail.\r\n&quot;

+  6644,  &quot;Log space cannot be reclaimed because the log is pinned.\r\n&quot;
+  6645,  &quot;Log metadata flush failed.\r\n&quot;

+  6647,  &quot;Records were appended to the log or reservation changes were made, but the log could not be flushed.\r\n&quot;
+  6648,  &quot;The log is pinned due to reservation consuming most of the log space. Free some reserved records to make space available.\r\n&quot;
+  6700,  &quot;The transaction handle associated with this operation is not valid.\r\n&quot;
+  6701,  &quot;The requested operation was made in the context of a transaction that is no longer active.\r\n&quot;
+  6702,  &quot;The requested operation is not valid on the Transaction object in its current state.\r\n&quot;
+  6703,  &quot;The caller has called a response API, but the response is not expected because the TM did not issue the corresponding request to the caller.\r\n&quot;
+  6704,  &quot;It is too late to perform the requested operation, since the Transaction has already been aborted.\r\n&quot;
+  6705,  &quot;It is too late to perform the requested operation, since the Transaction has already been committed.\r\n&quot;
+  6706,  &quot;The Transaction Manager was unable to be successfully initialized. Transacted operations are not supported.\r\n&quot;
+  6707,  &quot;The specified ResourceManager made no changes or updates to the resource under this transaction.\r\n&quot;
+  6708,  &quot;The resource manager has attempted to prepare a transaction that it has not successfully joined.\r\n&quot;
+  6709,  &quot;The Transaction object already has a superior enlistment, and the caller attempted an operation that would have created a new superior. Only a single superior enlistment is allow.\r\n&quot;
+  6710,  &quot;The RM tried to register a protocol that already exists.\r\n&quot;
+  6711,  &quot;The attempt to propagate the Transaction failed.\r\n&quot;
+  6712,  &quot;The requested propagation protocol was not registered as a CRM.\r\n&quot;
+  6713,  &quot;The buffer passed in to PushTransaction or PullTransaction is not in a valid format.\r\n&quot;
+  6714,  &quot;The current transaction context associated with the thread is not a valid handle to a transaction object.\r\n&quot;
+  6715,  &quot;The specified Transaction object could not be opened, because it was not found.\r\n&quot;
+  6716,  &quot;The specified ResourceManager object could not be opened, because it was not found.\r\n&quot;
+  6717,  &quot;The specified Enlistment object could not be opened, because it was not found.\r\n&quot;
+  6718,  &quot;The specified TransactionManager object could not be opened, because it was not found.\r\n&quot;
+  6719,  &quot;The object specified could not be created or opened, because its associated TransactionManager is not online.  The TransactionManager must be brought fully Online by calling RecoverTransactionManager to recover to the end of its LogFile before objects in its Transaction or ResourceManager namespaces can be opened.  In addition, errors in writing records to its LogFile can cause a TransactionManager to go offline.\r\n&quot;
+  6720,  &quot;The specified TransactionManager was unable to create the objects contained in its logfile in the Ob namespace. Therefore, the TransactionManager was unable to recover.\r\n&quot;
+  6721,  &quot;The call to create a superior Enlistment on this Transaction object could not be completed, because the Transaction object specified for the enlistment is a subordinate branch of the Transaction. Only the root of the Transaction can be enlisted on as a superior.\r\n&quot;
+  6722,  &quot;Because the associated transaction manager or resource manager has been closed, the handle is no longer valid.\r\n&quot;
+  6723,  &quot;The specified operation could not be performed on this Superior enlistment, because the enlistment was not created with the corresponding completion response in the NotificationMask.\r\n&quot;
+  6724,  &quot;The specified operation could not be performed, because the record that would be logged was too long. This can occur because of two conditions: either there are too many Enlistments on this Transaction, or the combined RecoveryInformation being logged on behalf of those Enlistments is too long.\r\n&quot;
+  6725,  &quot;Implicit transaction are not supported.\r\n&quot;
+  6726,  &quot;The kernel transaction manager had to abort or forget the transaction because it blocked forward progress.\r\n&quot;
+  6727,  &quot;The TransactionManager identity that was supplied did not match the one recorded in the TransactionManager's log file.\r\n&quot;
+  6728,  &quot;This snapshot operation cannot continue because a transactional resource manager cannot be frozen in its current state.  Please try again.\r\n&quot;
+  6729,  &quot;The transaction cannot be enlisted on with the specified EnlistmentMask, because the transaction has already completed the PrePrepare phase.  In order to ensure correctness, the ResourceManager must switch to a write-through mode and cease caching data within this transaction.  Enlisting for only subsequent transaction phases may still succeed.\r\n&quot;
+  6730,  &quot;The transaction does not have a superior enlistment.\r\n&quot;
+  6731,  &quot;The attempt to commit the Transaction completed, but it is possible that some portion of the transaction tree did not commit successfully due to heuristics.  Therefore it is possible that some data modified in the transaction may not have committed, resulting in transactional inconsistency.  If possible, check the consistency of the associated data.\r\n&quot;
+  6800,  &quot;The function attempted to use a name that is reserved for use by another transaction.\r\n&quot;
+  6801,  &quot;Transaction support within the specified resource manager is not started or was shut down due to an error.\r\n&quot;
+  6802,  &quot;The metadata of the RM has been corrupted. The RM will not function.\r\n&quot;
+  6803,  &quot;The specified directory does not contain a resource manager.\r\n&quot;
+  6805,  &quot;The remote server or share does not support transacted file operations.\r\n&quot;
+  6806,  &quot;The requested log size is invalid.\r\n&quot;
+  6807,  &quot;The object (file, stream, link) corresponding to the handle has been deleted by a Transaction Savepoint Rollback.\r\n&quot;
+  6808,  &quot;The specified file miniversion was not found for this transacted file open.\r\n&quot;
+  6809,  &quot;The specified file miniversion was found but has been invalidated. Most likely cause is a transaction savepoint rollback.\r\n&quot;
+  6810,  &quot;A miniversion may only be opened in the context of the transaction that created it.\r\n&quot;
+  6811,  &quot;It is not possible to open a miniversion with modify access.\r\n&quot;
+  6812,  &quot;It is not possible to create any more miniversions for this stream.\r\n&quot;
+  6814,  &quot;The remote server sent mismatching version number or Fid for a file opened with transactions.\r\n&quot;
+  6815,  &quot;The handle has been invalidated by a transaction. The most likely cause is the presence of memory mapping on a file or an open handle when the transaction ended or rolled back to savepoint.\r\n&quot;
+  6816,  &quot;There is no transaction metadata on the file.\r\n&quot;
+  6817,  &quot;The log data is corrupt.\r\n&quot;
+  6818,  &quot;The file can't be recovered because there is a handle still open on it.\r\n&quot;
+  6819,  &quot;The transaction outcome is unavailable because the resource manager responsible for it has disconnected.\r\n&quot;
+  6820,  &quot;The request was rejected because the enlistment in question is not a superior enlistment.\r\n&quot;
+  6821,  &quot;The transactional resource manager is already consistent. Recovery is not needed.\r\n&quot;
+  6822,  &quot;The transactional resource manager has already been started.\r\n&quot;
+  6823,  &quot;The file cannot be opened transactionally, because its identity depends on the outcome of an unresolved transaction.\r\n&quot;
+  6824,  &quot;The operation cannot be performed because another transaction is depending on the fact that this property will not change.\r\n&quot;
+  6825,  &quot;The operation would involve a single file with two transactional resource managers and is therefore not allowed.\r\n&quot;
+  6826,  &quot;The $Txf directory must be empty for this operation to succeed.\r\n&quot;
+  6827,  &quot;The operation would leave a transactional resource manager in an inconsistent state and is therefore not allowed.\r\n&quot;
+  6828,  &quot;The operation could not be completed because the transaction manager does not have a log.\r\n&quot;
+  6829,  &quot;A rollback could not be scheduled because a previously scheduled rollback has already executed or been queued for execution.\r\n&quot;
+  6830,  &quot;The transactional metadata attribute on the file or directory is corrupt and unreadable.\r\n&quot;
+  6831,  &quot;The encryption operation could not be completed because a transaction is active.\r\n&quot;
+  6832,  &quot;This object is not allowed to be opened in a transaction.\r\n&quot;
+  6833,  &quot;An attempt to create space in the transactional resource manager's log failed. The failure status has been recorded in the event log.\r\n&quot;
+  6834,  &quot;Memory mapping (creating a mapped section) a remote file under a transaction is not supported.\r\n&quot;
+  6835,  &quot;Transaction metadata is already present on this file and cannot be superseded.\r\n&quot;
+  6836,  &quot;A transaction scope could not be entered because the scope handler has not been initialized.\r\n&quot;
+  6837,  &quot;Promotion was required in order to allow the resource manager to enlist, but the transaction was set to disallow it.\r\n&quot;
+  6838,  &quot;This file is open for modification in an unresolved transaction and may be opened for execute only by a transacted reader.\r\n&quot;
+  6839,  &quot;The request to thaw frozen transactions was ignored because transactions had not previously been frozen.\r\n&quot;
+  6840,  &quot;Transactions cannot be frozen because a freeze is already in progress.\r\n&quot;
+  6841,  &quot;The target volume is not a snapshot volume. This operation is only valid on a volume mounted as a snapshot.\r\n&quot;
+  6842,  &quot;The savepoint operation failed because files are open on the transaction. This is not permitted.\r\n&quot;
+  6843,  &quot;Windows has discovered corruption in a file, and that file has since been repaired. Data loss may have occurred.\r\n&quot;
+  6844,  &quot;The sparse operation could not be completed because a transaction is active on the file.\r\n&quot;
+  6845,  &quot;The call to create a TransactionManager object failed because the Tm Identity stored in the logfile does not match the Tm Identity that was passed in as an argument.\r\n&quot;
+  6846,  &quot;I/O was attempted on a section object that has been floated as a result of a transaction ending. There is no valid data.\r\n&quot;
+  6847,  &quot;The transactional resource manager cannot currently accept transacted work due to a transient condition such as low resources.\r\n&quot;
+  6848,  &quot;The transactional resource manager had too many tranactions outstanding that could not be aborted. The transactional resource manger has been shut down.\r\n&quot;
+  6849,  &quot;The operation could not be completed due to bad clusters on disk.\r\n&quot;
+  6850,  &quot;The compression operation could not be completed because a transaction is active on the file.\r\n&quot;
+  6851,  &quot;The operation could not be completed because the volume is dirty. Please run chkdsk and try again.\r\n&quot;
+  6852,  &quot;The link tracking operation could not be completed because a transaction is active.\r\n&quot;
+  6853,  &quot;This operation cannot be performed in a transaction.\r\n&quot;
+  6854,  &quot;The handle is no longer properly associated with its transaction.  It may have been opened in a transactional resource manager that was subsequently forced to restart.  Please close the handle and open a new one.\r\n&quot;
+  6855,  &quot;The specified operation could not be performed because the resource manager is not enlisted in the transaction.\r\n&quot;
